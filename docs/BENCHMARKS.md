# Benchmarks

Every number here was measured on the machine described beside it, by a script in this repo
that you can run. Nothing is quoted from a single run.

```sh
scripts/bench.sh 20                                  # wake latency, distribution
go test -run '^$' -bench RoundTrip -count 12 .       # proxy overhead, for benchstat
./sbx selftest                                       # the whole cycle, ~9s
./scripts/e2e.sh 3                                   # several sandboxes at once
./scripts/recovery.sh                                # kill the daemon, twice
```

## Wake

| | median | detail |
|---|---|---|
| docker | **191 ms** | n=20, p90 232 ms, stdev 24 ms |
| kubernetes | **1534 ms** | n=5, min 1362, max 2060 — a pod must be scheduled |

For scale, published figures: E2B 662 ms resume, Daytona 1254 ms, Neon 300–500 ms. Those are
hosted platforms; these are a laptop and a minikube.

### How it got there

The first honest measurement was **5282 ms, stdev 22 ms**, and the consistency was the
finding — 0.4% spread is not variable work, it is one fixed cost:

```
   docker start           110 ms   ← redis is already serving here
   State.Health=healthy  +5030 ms  ← docker republishes on its check interval
```

98% of a wake was spent waiting for the platform to notice something that had already
happened. Running the declared health command directly sees it in ~150 ms.

```
   wake     5282 ms → 191 ms
   create   5769 ms → 492 ms
   cluster 18200 ms → 1534 ms
```

## Proxy overhead

The wake is a one-off; this is the tax on every query for the life of the sandbox.

```
             │ direct      │ proxied     │
             │ sec/op      │ sec/op      vs base
RoundTrip-10   14.52µ ± 3%   30.10µ ± 8%  +107.32% (p=0.000 n=12)
```

**About 15 µs, which is +107% or +7% depending entirely on the baseline.** Against a bare
loopback echo it doubles the round trip. Against a real query that already crosses a VM
boundary at 426 µs it disappears. Quoting only the flattering number was a mistake this
table exists to prevent.

## Memory

Both containers fresh, both idle, same image — which is the only comparison that means
anything:

| | stock | tuned |
|---|---|---|
| `mysql:8.0` | 411 MB | **110 MB** |
| `clickhouse:24.3` | 199 MB | 201 MB |
| a sleeping sandbox | — | **0 B** |
| the daemon | — | 4.5 MB |

MySQL's saving is real and comes from `performance_schema=OFF` and a 48 MB buffer pool.

**ClickHouse's does not exist**, and an earlier version of this file claimed 1198 MB → 189 MB.
That compared a loaded server carrying real data against a fresh empty one and credited the
difference to configuration. An idle ClickHouse is about 200 MB either way; the cache caps
matter under load, not at rest. The same mistake inflated the MySQL figure from 3.7× to 6×.

## Conditions matter

`scripts/bench.sh` prints host load and VM memory alongside its results, because a wake on
an idle laptop and a wake on one that is paging are not the same measurement. Several
figures in this project's history were taken during a period when the VM had 107 MB free and
a load average of 20; they were wrong by an order of magnitude and are not in this file.
